Hello and welcome to my banking system project repository!

This project has been a challenge for me, but I am proud to say that I have completed it successfully. In this project, I have built a complete banking system that meets all the requirements and specifications.

The system has 4 types of accounts: StudentChecking, Checking, Savings, and CreditCard. Each type of account has its own unique features and attributes, such as balance, secret key, interest rate, and more.

The system also has 3 types of users: Admins, AccountHolders, and ThirdParty. Admins are able to create new accounts and have access to all account information. AccountHolders have access to their own account information and can transfer money between their accounts. ThirdParty users can receive and send money to other accounts with proper credentials.

One of the key features of this project is the interest and fees applied to each type of account. Savings accounts have an annual interest rate and credit cards have a monthly interest rate. If an account drops below the minimum balance, a penalty fee will be automatically deducted from the account balance.

Important! 
You have inside the project, a postman file with all the endpoints working.
Sorry for the tests ... Next time they will be much better.
